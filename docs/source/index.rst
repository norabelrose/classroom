Welcome to Classroom's documentation!
=====================================

Classroom is an open source Python library for teaching reinforcement learning agents about human preferences.
It comes packaged with a browser-based GUI for providing human feedback to RL agents. Classroom builds upon
OpenAI's popular [Gym](https://github.com/openai/gym) library for reinforcement learning environments, and aims
to be compatible with all three major neural network frameworks: PyTorch, JAX, and TensorFlow. The goal of
Classroom is to make preference-based reinforcement learning _easy_, requiring only a few extra lines of code
on top of the usual RL pipeline.
